## About the Video Course
Java EE application model represents one of the best available design models on which to base the design of your enterprise application. This course will address the problems that Java EE developers have been facing for years – breaking the monolith! You’ll learn how to build microservices in Java EE 8, enabling you to create highly extendable, scalable, fault tolerant applications that are cloud-ready. 

Beginning with an introduction to microservices, you’ll learn how to start setting up your development environment and toolset. You’ll gain knowledge of tools such as Dropwizard, Payara Micro, and Spring Boot while you build RESTful services with the latest JAX-RS 2.1 standard. You’ll understand how to use Microprofile to optimize Java EE for microservices development. The course will go on to build an application based on the microservices architecture, where you will learn to test, secure, and monitor your microservices using the latest, most reliable tools. 

You’ll learn how to break down and refactor monolithic applications into microservices, as well as integrate both architectures in a fail-proof way. You’ll see how to integrate tools such as Docker with Java EE, giving you a foundation to build Cloud Native applications. Finally, you’ll find out how to integrate Spring into your development environment and how to apply the best design patterns to build robust microservices.

By the end of the course, taking the challenge of building a cloud-ready, enterprise application in the microservice architecture will be a walk in the park.
